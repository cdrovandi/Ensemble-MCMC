# Ensemble-MCMC
Computer code for implementing the ensemble MCMC method of https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02014.  

The article develops a new method for static parameter estimation of complex state space models by exploiting the ensemble Kalman Filter within a particle MCMC algorithm.

Each folder represents a different application. Please see the README file in each folder for more information on how to run the code.
